Discord-rest is a wrapper for the Discord REST API, in usage on Discord Slash Commands, Webhooks, and more.
Support is also planned soon for oauth2.

##Â Thing to know

- Discord-rest is not a library similar to Discord.js, you can't connect a bot with it.
- Discord-rest is made for WebSite backends, and Webhooks endpoints for slash commands.
- You can't use in the browser, but you can use it in Node.js with the [`node-fetch`](https://npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) module or with the window.fetch() function in some React environments that expose it.
- Discord-rest don't have a cache system, because it's not used for a long time usage.
